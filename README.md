E-COMMERCE WEB API
This project is a digital products platform developed as part of the Patika.dev & Papara .Net Bootcamp. The platform allows users to purchase digital products and product licenses through three channels: Android, iOS, and Web. Users can earn loyalty points with each purchase, which can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases. The platform also supports a coupon system, enabling users to make purchases at reduced prices.
